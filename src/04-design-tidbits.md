"Design tidbits" are collections of techniques and explanations illustrated in bite-sized snippets.

We start with the obvious and gradually move into the not-so-obvious.

Iâ€™m speaking in the context of digital art, but most of these concepts apply to any medium.

I break these into three sections:

1. **Line**. The focus here is line-art, no color - the simplest way to put ideas on canvas.
1. **Perspective**. Tips on perspective and lenses.
1. **Color**. Take the line-art to the next level with color. Or completely upgrade to painting.
1. **Extra**. Explorative ideas on coming up with designs in the first place.

**Pick and choose which techniques you want to use during your practice, and do it deliberately!**
